# 🌐 Personal Cloud Portfolio using AmazonQ

This is a **personal cloud portfolio** website built using **React.js** and developed with assistance from **Amazon Q** inside **Visual Studio Code**.

> ⚡ Inspired by the live demo presented by Mr. [Shubham Londhe](https://github.com/LondheShubham153), AWS Developer Advocate, during the **DevOps Meets AI** event. His [GitHub repo](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/amazon-q-rules) served as a base for this project, which I later customized with my own theme and content.
