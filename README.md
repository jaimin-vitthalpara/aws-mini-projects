# 🌐 Learn-by-Building: AWS Cloud Lab with Real-World Projects by Jaimin Vitthalpara

Hello! I'm **Jaimin Vitthalpara**, a passionate and self-driven learner in the world of **Cloud Computing & DevOps**. This repository is a showcase of my personal journey through building **real-world AWS mini-projects** — each one designed to sharpen my skills, understand services in depth, and apply theoretical knowledge to practical use cases.

Over time, I’ve realized the best way to learn cloud is by doing. That’s why I created this open-source repository — to document, demonstrate, and share every project I build. Each `.md` file here is not just project documentation — it’s a detailed guide with configurations, reasoning, and best practices that can help others who are starting out or looking to strengthen their AWS skills.

## ✨ What This Repository Offers

- ✅ 10+ **AWS Projects**, each solving a specific real-world use case
- ✅ Written in **clean Markdown documentation**
- ✅ Step-by-step explanation and architectural breakdown
- ✅ Uses a variety of AWS services like EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudFront, Auto Scaling, CodePipeline, DynamoDB, Kinesis, and more
- ✅ Projects built with **Terraform, Jenkins, Docker**, and other DevOps tools

Whether you're a student, fresher, job-seeker, or someone preparing for AWS certifications — this repo will serve as a practical reference to learn from and build your own solutions.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

The goal was simple: **Learn by Building.**  

I didn’t just want to watch tutorials or read documentation. I wanted to take ownership of the process — from understanding the service, to deploying it, to troubleshooting real-world issues. These mini-projects are a reflection of that learning.

Through these projects, I’ve not only gained deeper insights into AWS, but also developed skills in automation, version control, CI/CD, and infrastructure provisioning — all of which are essential for becoming a proficient **DevOps or Cloud Engineer**.
