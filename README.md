## **Final Review/Overview**

In this guide, we walked through the process of hosting a Photography Portfolio Website on AWS S3. First, we created an S3 bucket with a unique name and selected the appropriate region. Next, we uploaded the website files (HTML, CSS, JS, and images) to the bucket. Then, we configured the bucket permissions by adding a Bucket Policy that grants public access to all the files using the `s3:GetObject` action. After that, we used the Policy Generator to create the policy and applied it to the bucket. Finally, we enabled Static Website Hosting, retrieved the public URL, and tested it in the browser to verify the website was live. 

Following these steps ensures that your static website is publicly accessible, simple to manage, and cost-effective, providing a seamless way to showcase your work online.
