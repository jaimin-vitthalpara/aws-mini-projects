# S3 and CloudFront Distribution Setup

This guide demonstrates the process of hosting a static website using AWS S3 and CloudFront. Follow these steps to create an S3 bucket, configure a CloudFront distribution, and deploy your website.

## Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket and Upload Files

1. Go to the [S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
2. Click **Create bucket**.
3. Enter a **unique bucket name** and choose a region.
4. Upload your website files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) to the bucket.
5. Ensure that your files are publicly accessible by setting appropriate permissions.

> **Tip:** S3 is a highly scalable object storage service. By uploading your website files to S3, you are essentially storing them in the cloud, ready for distribution.

## Step 2: Create CloudFront Distribution

1. Go to the [CloudFront Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).
2. Click **Create Distribution**.
3. Select the **Web** delivery method for the distribution.

CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches your websiteâ€™s static content at edge locations across the globe. This helps improve performance by serving content from locations closest to the users.

> **Tip:** CloudFront speeds up delivery by using edge locations, meaning users accessing your website will get faster load times since data is fetched from a nearby location, not directly from the S3 bucket.

## Step 3: Select the Origin Domain

1. Under **Origin Settings**, select your S3 bucket from the **Origin Domain** dropdown menu.
2. The S3 bucket you created earlier should appear in the dropdown list.

*Screenshot:*

> **Explanation:** In CloudFront, the **origin** refers to where the content is coming from. In this case, the S3 bucket will serve as the origin for your CloudFront distribution. CloudFront fetches content from this origin when users request it.

## Step 4: Configure Origin Access

1. In the **Origin Access Control** section, select **Origin access control settings (recommended)**.
   
    ### 4.1 Create New OAC:
   - Click on **Create new OAC**.
   - Enter your S3 bucket name when prompted.

2. ### 4.2 Select the Created OAC:
   - In the dropdown, select the OAC you just created.

*Screenshot:*

> **Explanation:** CloudFront uses **Origin Access Control (OAC)** to securely fetch content from your S3 bucket. By creating and selecting an OAC, you're ensuring that only CloudFront can access your S3 bucket, preventing direct public access to your bucket's files.

## Step 5: Set Cache Policy

- Under **Cache Policy**, you can choose either a custom policy or use the default policy. I have selected the default policy.

*Screenshot:*

![Cache Policy](./screenshots/cache_policy.png)

> **Explanation:** The cache policy defines how CloudFront caches your content at edge locations. By choosing the default policy, CloudFront will cache your content based on standard HTTP headers, improving response time and reducing the load on your S3 bucket.

## Step 6: Disable WAF

- In the **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** section, select **Disable WAF**.

> **Note:** WAF (Web Application Firewall) is a service to help protect your site from malicious traffic. For simplicity, we are disabling it in this practice setup. However, it's recommended to enable WAF in production environments.

## Step 7: Create the Distribution

1. After configuring the settings, click **Create Distribution**.
2. A notification will appear saying "Copy Policy".

*Screenshot:*

> **Tip:** After creating the distribution, CloudFront will start deploying your settings. This process can take some time because CloudFront is propagating your settings across its global edge network.

## Step 8: Update S3 Bucket Policy

1. Copy the **Policy** from the CloudFront notification.
2. Go to your S3 bucket settings.
3. Under **Permissions**, click on **Bucket Policy**.
4. Paste the copied policy and click **Save Changes**.

*Screenshot:*

![S3 Bucket Policy](./screenshots/s3_bucket_policy.png)

> **Explanation:** This policy allows CloudFront to access the S3 bucket's content securely. By pasting it in your S3 bucket's policy, you're granting CloudFront the necessary permissions to serve the files.

## Step 9: Configure CloudFront Distribution Settings

1. Go back to the **CloudFront Console**.
2. Find the distribution you just created, which will be in the **Deploying** stage.
3. Open the distribution, go to **Settings**, and click **Edit**.
4. In the **Default Root Object** field, enter the name of your default HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).

*Screenshot:*

![Default Root Object](./screenshots/default_root_object.png)

> **Explanation:** The **Default Root Object** is the file CloudFront will serve when users access the root URL of your domain (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com`). Typically, this would be `index.html` for most websites.

## Step 10: Wait for Distribution Deployment

1. Wait for the distribution to deploy. This process may take several minutes as CloudFront propagates across edge locations worldwide.
2. Once deployed, you will see a timestamp indicating deployment completion.
3. Copy the **Distribution Domain Name** provided by CloudFront.

*Screenshot:*

![Distribution Domain](./screenshots/distribution_domain.png)

> **Explanation:** CloudFront deploys content to its edge locations around the world. Once deployed, CloudFront will distribute your website from multiple locations to ensure fast access for global users. The **Distribution Domain Name** is the URL that you will use to access your website.

## Step 11: Access the Website

1. Open your browser and paste the **Distribution Domain Name**.
2. Your website should be live!

> **Final Note:** After successful deployment, CloudFront acts as the CDN (Content Delivery Network) that caches and serves your website content to end-users. This improves the speed and reliability of your website.

Now your website is hosted via S3 and CloudFront! You can share the CloudFront distribution domain to allow users to access the site.
