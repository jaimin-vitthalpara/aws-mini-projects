# Hosting a Static Website on AWS S3 using Terraform

This guide will help you host a static photography portfolio website on AWS S3 using Terraform. Follow the steps to configure AWS, create an S3 bucket, enable static website hosting, and upload your website files.

## Prerequisites
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) installed
- AWS CLI configured
- AWS IAM User with programmatic access (Access Key & Secret Key)

## Steps

### Step 1: Install Terraform in VS Code
1. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install the **Terraform Extension** for VS Code:
   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to the **Extensions** tab (left sidebar).
   - Search for "Terraform" and click **Install**.
3. Download Terraform and follow the installation instructions [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).

### Step 2: Create the `main.tf` File and Configure AWS Provider
1. In your project folder, create a file named `main.tf`.
2. Inside `main.tf`, define the Terraform configuration for the AWS provider. This configuration sets up the region, access key, and secret key for your AWS environment. If you donâ€™t have an access key or secret key, create an IAM user by following [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).
   
   ```hcl
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       aws = {
         source  = "hashicorp/aws"
         version = "~> 5.0"
       }
     }
   }

   provider "aws" {
     region     = "us-east-1"
     access_key = "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY"
     secret_key = "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY"
   }
```

### **Step 3: Create a New S3 Bucket**

In this step, we will create an S3 bucket to host your photography portfolio website.

1. **Add the S3 Bucket Configuration**:
   In the `main.tf` file, add the following code to create a new S3 bucket for your website:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "photography-portfolio-bucket"  # Replace with a unique bucket name
  tags = {
    Name = "Photography Portfolio Website"  # Tagging the bucket
  }
}
